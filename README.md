# 📊 YouTube Data Scraping & Analysis: Top Data Engineering Channels
Welcome to the YouTube Data Scraping and Analysis project, where we dive deep into the world of Data Engineering YouTube channels! If you're curious about which videos are making waves, how top channels are performing, or what kind of content resonates with viewers—this project has you covered.

Using the YouTube Data API, we’ve scraped detailed video data from the biggest names in the Data Engineering space and analyzed key metrics like views, likes, comments, and publishing trends. Let’s see what the numbers reveal!

# 🚀 Features
YouTube Data Scraping: Collected metadata from videos on top Data Engineering YouTube channels, including:
Titles
View counts, likes, and comments
Publishing dates
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Prepared the data for analysis by:
Converting publish dates into year and month for trend tracking
Handling missing or incomplete data (because real-world data is never perfect, right?)
Data Insights & Visualization: Unveiled interesting patterns like:
Most popular videos based on views, likes, and comments
Year-over-year trends in video publishing activity
How content across different channels stacks up against each other
Interactive Visuals: Eye-catching graphs and charts help tell the story behind the data:
Bar charts of the top-performing videos 📊
Multi-bar plots showing video trends over time 📅

# 🔮 What’s Next?
This project opens up a lot of exciting possibilities! Some ideas for future work:


Airflow Orchestration: Automate the data scraping and analysis workflow with Apache Airflow for regular updates.

AWS S3 Integration: Store the scraped video data in AWS S3 for reliable, scalable storage, making it easy to access for further analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyze viewer comments to understand audience engagement better.

Predictive Models: Use machine learning to predict future video performance based on historical data, helping guide content strategies for YouTubers.
